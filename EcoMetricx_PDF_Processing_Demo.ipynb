    "Welcome to **EcoMetricx** - an advanced PDF processing system designed to extract maximum value from energy documents and reports. This notebook demonstrates a complete pipeline that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- üìÑ **Extract text** from PDFs using multiple intelligent methods\n",
    "- üëÅÔ∏è **Process visual content** exactly as humans see it \n",
    "- üîç **Identify and extract** tables, charts, and images automatically\n",

    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional PDF extraction often fails because:\n",
    "- **Hidden text layers** may contain garbled or invisible data\n",
    "- **Visual elements** like charts and tables are difficult to parse programmatically\n",
    "- **Different PDF formats** require different extraction strategies\n",
