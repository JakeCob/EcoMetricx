    "\n",
    "Welcome to **EcoMetricx** - an advanced PDF processing system designed to extract maximum value from energy documents and reports. This notebook demonstrates a complete pipeline that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📄 **Extract text** from PDFs using multiple intelligent methods\n",
    "- 👁️ **Process visual content** exactly as humans see it \n",
    "- 🔍 **Identify and extract** tables, charts, and images automatically\n",
    "- 🤖 **Apply OCR technology** to capture text from screenshots\n",
    "- 📊 **Provide diagnostic insights** about extraction quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional PDF extraction often fails because:\n",
    "- **Hidden text layers** may contain garbled or invisible data\n",
    "- **Visual elements** like charts and tables are difficult to parse programmatically\n",
    "- **Different PDF formats** require different extraction strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution uses a **hybrid approach** that combines the best of both worlds: programmatic efficiency and visual accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Understanding the Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional PDF text extraction often fails because:\n",
    "- **Hidden layers** may contain invisible or garbled text\n",
    "- **Scanned documents** appear as images to standard extractors  \n",
    "- **Complex layouts** can scramble the reading order\n",
    "- **Embedded fonts** may render incorrectly\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution provides **two complementary approaches**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. 🚀 Enhanced PDF Extractor\n",
    "- **Fast and efficient** programmatic extraction\n",
    "- **Multi-method approach** with intelligent fallback\n",
    "- **Best for**: Text-based PDFs with embedded text layers\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Speed, accuracy for standard documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 👁️ Visual PDF Extractor  \n",
    "- **Screenshot-based** extraction using OCR\n",
    "- **Sees exactly what humans see** on the page\n",
    "- **Best for**: Scanned documents, complex layouts, visual content\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Works with any PDF type, handles visual elements\n",
    "\n",

    "## 👁️ Method 2: Visual PDF Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Visual PDF Extractor** takes screenshots of PDF pages and uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read the text. This method sees exactly what a human would see when looking at the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "1. **PDF to Image**: Converts each PDF page to a high-resolution screenshot (300 DPI)\n",
    "2. **Image Preprocessing**: Enhances image quality for better OCR results\n",
    "3. **OCR Processing**: Uses Google's Tesseract engine to read text from images\n",
    "4. **Confidence Scoring**: Measures how confident the OCR is about each word\n",
    "5. **Post-processing**: Cleans and formats the extracted text\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use Visual Extraction:\n",
    "- ✅ **Scanned documents** (PDFs that are actually just images)\n",
    "- ✅ **Complex layouts** with unusual formatting\n",
    "- ✅ **Visual elements** mixed with text\n",
    "- ✅ **When programmatic methods fail**"
