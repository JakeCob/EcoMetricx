    "\n",
    "Welcome to **EcoMetricx** - an advanced PDF processing system designed to extract maximum value from energy documents and reports. This notebook demonstrates a complete pipeline that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📄 **Extract text** from PDFs using multiple intelligent methods\n",
    "- 👁️ **Process visual content** exactly as humans see it \n",
    "- 🔍 **Identify and extract** tables, charts, and images automatically\n",
    "- 🤖 **Apply OCR technology** to capture text from screenshots\n",
    "- 📊 **Provide diagnostic insights** about extraction quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional PDF extraction often fails because:\n",
    "- **Hidden text layers** may contain garbled or invisible data\n",
    "- **Visual elements** like charts and tables are difficult to parse programmatically\n",
    "- **Different PDF formats** require different extraction strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution uses a **hybrid approach** that combines the best of both worlds: programmatic efficiency and visual accuracy.\n",
